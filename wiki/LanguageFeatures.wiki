#summary Language features of FridgeScript

= Introduction =

This page describes the FridgeScript language itself, rather than the details of the compiler implementation provided.


= Details =

There are several aspects to the language of FridgeScript that probably should be documented here:
  * Grammar (i.e. the LBNF used)
  * Functionality (e.g. what statements do, what operators do)
  * Concepts (e.g. functions, conditionals, lazy evaluation, out-of-order execution)
