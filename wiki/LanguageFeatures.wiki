= Introduction =

This page describes the FridgeScript language itself, rather than the details of the compiler implementation provided.


= Details =

There are several aspects to the language of FridgeScript:

== Grammar == 

The [Grammar grammar] is documented on the wiki, but the exact LBNF (labelled Backus-Naur form) grammar used for FridgeScript can be found in FridgeScript.cf in the source.

== Functionality ==
  * [MathOperators Mathematical operators]
  * [AssignmentOperators Assignment operators]
  * [LogicalOperators Logical operators]
  * [BitwiseOperators Bitwise operators] (not fully implemented)
  * [MathFunctions Built-in mathematical functions]
  * [if If statements]
  * [while While], [until] and [for] loops
  * [Function User-defined functions] and function calls from within expressions (not fully implemented)

== Concepts ==
  * [Expression Expression evaluation]
  * [if Branching]
  * [Loops]
  * [Function Functions] (not fully implemented)
  * [LazyEvaluation Lazy evaluation] (not fully implemented)
