= Introduction =

This page describes the FridgeScript language itself, rather than the details of the compiler implementation provided.


= Details =

There are several aspects to the language of FridgeScript:

== Grammar == 

The [Grammar grammar] is documented on the wiki, but the exact LBNF (labelled Backus-Naur form) grammar used for FridgeScript can be found in FridgeScript.cf in the source, a more human readable version is in DocFridgeScript.html which was generated by BNFC and has some extra stuff done to it by a script.

== Functionality ==
  * [MathOperators Mathematical operators]
  * Logical operators
  * Bitwise operators (not fully implemented)
  * [MathFunctions Built-in mathematical functions]
  * Branching with [if] statements
  * Loops with [while], [until] and [for].
  * User-defined functions and function calls from within expressions (not fully implemented)

== Concepts ==
  * [Expression Expression evaluation]
  * [if Branching]
  * Loops
  * Functions
  * Lazy evaluation
  * Constant expression evaluation
  * Symbolic optimisation and out-of-order execution
