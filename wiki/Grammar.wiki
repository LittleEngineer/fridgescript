= Introduction =

[http://fridgescript.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/DocFridgeScript.html DocFridgeScript.html] in the source repository contains the exact grammar used by FridgeScript described in labelled Backus-Naur form. The information in [http://fridgescript.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/DocFridgeScript.html DocFridgeScript.html] is generated by the same tool that generates the lexer and parser for FridgeScript, so it should always be trusted over any other information when using the [FridgeScript] compiler.
