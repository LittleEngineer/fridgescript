= Introduction =

A while [Loops loop] runs until a test fails. 


= Details =

While loops run until their condition, defined by an [Expression expression], evaluates to zero. Although they enclose code with what looks like a C++ style scope this simply acts to contain code and doesn't clean up variables at its end. 

= Example =

{{{
i = 0;

loop while( i < 10 )
{
    ++i;
    j = i + 1;
}

// i == 10
// j == 11 and can be accessed and altered here:
++j;
// j == 12
}}}
