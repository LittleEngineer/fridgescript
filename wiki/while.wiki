= Introduction =

A while loop runs until a test fails. 


= Details =

While loops run until their condition fails. Although they enclose code with what looks like a C++ style scope it simply acts to contain code and doesn't clean up variables at its end. 

= Example =

{{{
i = 0;

while( i < 10 )
{
    ++i;
}

// i == 10;
}}}
